# Backend Blockchain Bridge Evaluation

## Description
* Analyzed the performance of blockchain interoperability protocols for a web3 company, Orb Labs. This project focused on designing and implementing a robust backend system for tracking and evaluating transactions on EVM-based blockchains, starting with Ethereum.
* Utilized TypeScript and web3 libraries to interface with Ethereum blockchain, implementing best practices for code structure and organization. 
* Gained hands-on experience with relational databases, particularly PostgreSQL, for storing and managing data that needs to be persisted. Utilized TypeORM and migrations to ensure proper version control and schema management, demonstrating expertise in database interactions.
* Leveraged external APIs, including Alchemy, for querying data from various blockchain networks. 
* Successfully implemented listeners to monitor blockchain events, extracting and parsing data to use for calculating and normalizing transaction costs and related metrics. 
* Designed and exposed APIs to provide crucial information on the best time for bridging USDC tokens from Ethereum using Stargate. 
* Developed a strong understanding of blockchain technology and its role in the web3 ecosystem. Acquired knowledge of smart contract development and token standards (ERC20).
