# Backend Blockchain Insights

## Description
* Worker with project leader to analyze the performance of blockchain interoperability protocols for a web3 company, Orb Labs, in partnership with Open Avenues, focusing on backend engineering fundamentals.
* Developed a strong understanding of blockchain technology and its role in the web3 ecosystem. Utilized JavaScript and web3 libraries to interface with diverse blockchain networks, implementing best practices for code structure and organization.
* Designed and exposed APIs to provide crucial information on the best time for bridging USDC tokens from Ethereum using Stargate. Leveraged external APIs, including Alchemy, for querying data from various blockchain networks. Honed skills in API design, data integration, and responsive web application development.
* Gained hands-on experience with relational databases, particularly PostgreSQL, for storing and managing blockchain-related data. Utilized TypeORM and migrations to ensure proper version control and schema management, demonstrating expertise in database interactions.
* Acquired knowledge of smart contract development and token standards (ERC20). Successfully implemented event listeners to monitor blockchain events, extracting and parsing data to improve understanding of transaction costs and related metrics.
* Skills: Javascript, Typescript, PostgreSQL, Docker, Ethereum, Web3 libraries (Web3.js, ethers.js), Alchemy
