# Backend Blockchain Bridge Evaluation

## Description
* Designed and implemented a robust backend system for tracking and evaluating transactions on EVM-based blockchains, to provide crucial information on the best time for bridging USDC tokens from Ethereum using Stargate. 
* Utilized TypeScript and web3 libraries to interface with Ethereum blockchain.
* Employed PostgreSQL, TypeORM, and migrations for efficient data storage and version-controlled schema management.
* Leveraged external APIs, including Alchemy, for querying data from various blockchain networks.
* Successfully implemented listeners to monitor blockchain events, extracting and parsing data to use for calculating and normalizing transaction costs and related metrics.
